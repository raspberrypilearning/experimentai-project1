Everybody has their own personal taste in music, but one thing humans can all agree on is that music can change your mood - it can pump you up, chill you out, help you focus and make you smile or cry. Music has been called the ‘universal language’ because of its ability to help humans communicate and influence others emotions through sound alone. 

You’re going to tap into this primal human response and use machine learning to create yourself a series of playlists that will provide the soundtrack to your life!

### Who is your user?

Before you can begin to create a solution, you need to know who you are creating it for, and why. What problem is your music solving?

You might want some music for getting pumped before a big event, or something to chill-out with before bed. You could listen to music that will help you focus on gaming, studying or making art… whatever you like! 

There are also opportunities to think about how you might help others by creating an app that selects music tailored to specific needs or uses for them - you could help someone who is hearing impaired find music they can more easily enjoy, or you could help a friend create some playlists to help them with their own wellbeing. You could create playlists that help find music from other countries, or listen to music only from independent artists, to help support them - there are lots of possibilities for this sort of application!

<h3> Music for social good:</h3>

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Promoting diversity and inclusivity:</span> Curated playlists can promote diversity and inclusivity by featuring artists from different backgrounds and cultures. This can help to expose listeners to new music and perspectives, and foster a sense of community and understanding.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Celebrating local artists:</span> Playlists can also be used to support local artists and musicians. By featuring songs from local musicians, playlists can help to promote their work and raise their profile within the community.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Supporting wellness and mental health:</span> Curated playlists can also be used to support mental health by featuring songs that promote relaxation, mindfulness, and emotional regulation. Playlists can be shared with individuals who are struggling with mental health challenges, or used in therapy sessions to promote healing and self-care.

**Take some time now to discuss these questions:**

+ When are there times in your life that your user might want a musical influence?
+ What feelings or responses to you want your user to feel??
+ What styles of music, artists or songs might make them feel that way?

### What are your playlists for?

First, you’ll need to choose some times in your life for when you want a music playlist - these will be your **classes**. 

**Remember** - everyone has different musical tastes, and what makes you feel one way may not match with someone else’s experience…and that’s totally ok.

Music has been used for centuries to promote wellness and healing in different cultures around the world. Here are some ways music can be used for wellness:

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Stress reduction:</span> Listening to calming music can help reduce stress and anxiety levels, as well as lower heart rate and blood pressure.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Pain management:</span> Music has been shown to reduce the perception of pain in patients undergoing medical procedures or recovering from surgery.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Boosting mood:</span> Music can be used to uplift and improve mood, especially when listening to music that evokes positive memories or emotions.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Improving cognitive function:</span> Playing an instrument or singing can improve cognitive function, memory, and language skills.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Enhancing physical performance:</span> Music can help to increase motivation, endurance, and energy levels during exercise or physical activity.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Supporting mental health:</span> Music therapy has been used to help individuals with depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions by promoting relaxation, self-expression, and emotional regulation.

title: Pro tip - Musical genres
---

For each playlist class, try to think of some musical genres that might match the energy you’re going for. This will help later, when we are searching for music. Knowing artists and songs that fit the playlists is helpful too; you can find out what genres your favourite artists fall under and find more artists like them which you may not know!

Some tips:
+ Pick two or three genres for each playlist class (you can have a genre in more than one class) so you don’t end up with a playlist that is too narrow or ‘samey’

+ Think of some of your favourite songs or artists and use a search engine to find out what genre of music they play - there is an [excellent tool available at everynoise.com](https://everynoise.com/){:target="_blank"} where you can search by artist and see their genre

+ Think about TV, movie or video game soundtracks that inspire you and search up the artists and genres of the music it contains

**Congratulations!** You've reached the end of the first stage of your quest! 

Now that you have your playlist classes, you need to start listening to music and classifying it to show your machine learning model what you like.

You will be classifying music based on two things: 
1. **Whether you like it:** If you don’t like it, it’ll be rejected - music that sounds like that won’t be recommended to you.
2. **Which playlist it fits:** If you do like it, you’ll need to decide which of your playlists it fits into

<p style='border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;'>
<span style="color: #0faeb0">Hold Up:</span> You can’t move forward from this point until you have chosen your playlist classes are and what genres of music fit into them - the next stage is building the Scratch classification program so you can listen to music!
